# Annotating Cryptasterina
Code and workflow for annotating Cryptasterina hystera and pentagona
<br>
Still working on uploading some of my work from this but annotation files are large!
<br>
### Working files
Most of my analysis, code, and "paper" for this project is in the annotate_crypt folder. The PDF file there is what I would consult to track what I have done
### Annotation workflow
