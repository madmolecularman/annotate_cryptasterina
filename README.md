# Annotating Cryptasterina
Github repository to contain project code and workflow for annotating *Cryptasterina* *hystera* and *pentagona*

<br>

I will continue working on uploading some of my work as this project evolves. Discussions with my advisor on hwo we go about making the data public needs to be addressed first, because this is ontgoing research. Unfortuantely, the annotation files are large and github is unable to store them due to 100.00 mb cap. In the [paper](https://github.com/madmolecularman/annotate_cryptasterina/blob/master/annotate_crypt/crypt_work.pdf) there is ample explanation and listing of directories to see the work that has been accomplished so far.

### Working files

Most of my analysis, code, and "paper" for this project is in the annotate_crypt folder. The [paper](https://github.com/madmolecularman/annotate_cryptasterina/blob/master/annotate_crypt/crypt_work.pdf) there is what I would consult to track what I have done
